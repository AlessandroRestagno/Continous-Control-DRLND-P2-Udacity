## Learning algorithm

## Model architecture
The actor model is a neural network with one hidden layer with size 256. I used ReLU as the activation function and tanh is used in the final layer to return the action output.

The critic model is a neural network with four hidden layers of size 256, 256, 128 and 64. I used ReLU as the activation function and tanh is used in the final layer to return the action output.
